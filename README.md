## Motivation

Let us look at these great articles written by some very experiences developers - 

 1. [Phil Sturgeon says if you use json:api you do not need GraphQL](https://blog.runscope.com/posts/you-might-not-need-graphql)
 2. [Bill Doerrfeld writes about the benefits of json:api](https://nordicapis.com/the-benefits-of-using-json-api/)
 3. [Jorge says json:api is a simple alternative to GraphQL](https://react-etc.net/entry/json-api-is-a-simple-alternative-to-graphql-and-rest)
 4. [Jeremy Sherman says he is not impressed by json:api and GraphQL is better](https://jeremywsherman.com/blog/2016/07/23/why-im-meh-about-json-api/)
 5. [Brandur says GraphQL is the next frontier in Web Developement](https://brandur.org/api-paradigms)

If you ask me, I'd say -

And in fact, some of the most used public APIs like Github have both REST and GraphQL.

**jagql** lets you build a backend with both `{json:api}` and _GraphQL_ support really really fast.
